# Faculty Influence Project

This website is the final class project for the Unleashing Open Data with Python class offered through the Johns Hopkins University Master of Science in Government Analytics program. This project displays many of the skills developed in class including Python, HTML, and CSS coding, pulling data from APIs, and using Python packages to perform data analysis.

The Faculty Influence Project attempts to measure the influence of the percent of full-time faculty at a community college on that community college's graduation rate when controlling for the percent of students receiving Pell Grants (as a proxy for low-income status) and the percent of students who identify as white. Data from the US Department of Education's College Scorecard was collected via Python script and analyzed with an ordinary least squares regression using the statsmodels.api Python package.
