	<h2>Regression Output</h2>
	<p>The Python script returned the following linear regression formula:
	<p><b>graduation rate = .2528 -.3133(% students receiving Pell Grants) + .0632(% white students) + .1777(% full-time faculty)</b></p>

	<p>The first number, or the constant, is the expected graduation rate (25.28%) of a college with no white students, no full-time faculty, and no students receiving Pell Grants. This is not a realistic constant but an important starting point for the formula. The coefficients on the independent variables are the effect of that variable on the graduation rate when holding the other independent variables constant. For example, considering two schools with the same percentage of full-time faculty and Pell recipients, a one-unit increase in the percentage of white students would increase the graduation rate by 6.32%. Of the three independent variables considered in this regression, only the increased presence of Pell recipients has a negative effect on the graduation rate.

	The dependent variable is an institution's graduation rate. The model includes 113 observations. The R-squared is .197 and the adjusted R-squared is .175.

	<h2>Discussion and Impact</h2>
	<p>The regression results suggest a positive influence of full-time faculty on graduation rates, Pell recipients and white student percentages being equal. However, when performing statistical analyses, the most important consideration in whether to accept or reject the null hypothesis (in this case, the null hypothesis is that an increase in full-time faculty does not have a positive impact on graduation rates) is the presence or absence of statistical significance. Simply put, statistical significance is measured using a standard threshold, either 5% or 10% - this means that the chance the non-zero coefficient is random is less than 5% or 10%.</p>

	<p>The independent variable of interest, percent of full-time faculty, is significant at the 10% level (with a critical value of 1.645) but not the 5% level. This means that it may have some positive influence but because the 95% confidence interval (considered the range of plausible coefficients) includes zero, it is not possible to conclude there is a statistically significant effect.</p>

	<p>Because it is not possible with the current data set and methods to determine the presence or absence of a statistically significant relationship between full-time faculty and graduation rates, more research will need to be done. A variety of methods are suitable for further investigation, including regression discontinuity studies (looking at schools above and below a certain threshold of full-time faculty) and longitudinal studies (examining one school over time as its faculty composition changes). The results of a number of studies using quantitative data to examine effects will help colleges decide where to best allocate resources for student success, whether that is to increasing full-time faculty lines or elsewhere.</p>
