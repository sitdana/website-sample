	<h1>Research Question</h1>
	<hr />
		<h2>Significance</h2>
		<p>Higher education has long been a requirement to enter the best paying professions, and recent research suggests this trend is only accelerating - <a href="https://cew.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Recovery2020.ES_.Web_.pdf">one estimate</a> says 65% of all jobs in the US economy will require education beyond high school in 2020. At the same time the economy is demanding more education from workers, low-income high school students are <a href="https://higheredtoday.org/2015/11/25/where-have-all-the-low-income-students-gone/">less likely to enroll in college</a> despite increases in the amount of aid and reductions in the price of attendance. This disparity in access to higher education serves to dampen economic mobility for those born into the lowest incomes. At present, children born into the highest income decile have an expected family income <a href="http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/assets/2015/07/fsm-irs-report_artfinal.pdf?la=en"><em>three times</em></a> that of those born into the lowest income decile.</p>

		<h2>Problem</h2>
		<p>Community colleges, as open-enrollment institutions, serve populations with <a href="http://www.aacc.nche.edu/AboutCC/Pages/fastfactsfactsheet.aspx">multiple barriers to success</a>, including the low-income. At the same time, <a href="http://www.ccsse.org/docs/PTF_Special_Report.pdf">over half</a> of all community college classes are taught by part-time faculty, variously referred to as "contingent", "non-tenure-track", or "adjunct" faculty. The part-time nature of these appointments provides much less opportunity for interaction with students in a mentoring, tutoring, supportive, or advising capacity, all of which <a href="http://uwc.edu/sites/uwc.edu/files/imce-uploads/employees/academic-resources/esfy/_files/faculty-student_contact_outside_the_classroom.pdf">has been suggested</a> to improve low-income students' chance of retention and achievement.

		<h2>Research Question</h2>
		<p>Does the percentage of part-time faculty influence the graduation rates of low-income students?</p>

		<p>The present research seeks to determine the impact of the trend of replacing full-time faculty lines with part-time adjuncts on the graduation rates of low-income students. Does the lack of outside of classroom availability associated with part-time professors impact success?</p>
